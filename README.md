Extranote:

The Guidebook "Sanguine Scientiem" from Bloodmagic has some issue, because of changs of the recipes. 
The book can't show some recipes, we can't fix it because of missing commands and missing
opportunity to change the recipe ID in the Guidebook. 
Also we can't recreate the original recipe ID because of Crafttweaks.
